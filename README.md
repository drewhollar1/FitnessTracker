Project Overview
The Machine Learning Fitness Tracker is a Python-based application designed to count repetitions and classify different strength training exercises using motion data collected from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. This project utilizes a range of machine learning and signal processing techniques to create an effective exercise-tracking tool that can distinguish between five types of strength exercises.
